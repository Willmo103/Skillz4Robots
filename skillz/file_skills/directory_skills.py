# This module will consist of a collection of functions that will allow LLM's to interact with directories and files in
# a controlled manner. There will be a collection of data objects that will be used to store information about files and
# directories that will provide stateful information to help steer the LLM in the right direction. Examples of these
# objects are as follows:

# - File: <- Base class for all file objects
#    description:
#       an abstract base class for all file objects.
#    purpose:
#       This class will provide a base class for all file objects. This class will be used to create a common interface
#       for all file objects that will be used by the LLM. This will allow the LLM to interact with files in a
#       consistent manner.

#    Fields:
#       - path: str - the path to the file
#       - parent: Directory | None - the parent directory of the file
#       - was_modified: bool - a flag to indicate if the LLM has modified the file
#       - was_read: bool - a flag to indicate if the LLM has read the file
#       - versions: list - a list of versions of the file
#       - content: str - the content of the file
#       - filename: str - the name of the file
#       - extension: str - the extension of the file
#    Initialization:
#       - __init__: -> None
#           - self
#           - path: str - the path to the file
#           - parent: Directory | None = None - the parent directory of the file
#
#           - description:
#               initialize the file object
#           - procedure:
#               This method takes the path to the file as the base argument and initializes the file object with the
#               path and parent directory. The was_modified and was_read flags are set to False, the versions list is
#               initialized as an empty list, and the content is set to an empty string. The filename and extension
#               fields are set to the name and extension of the file respectively. The filename and extension fields
#               set to the name and extension of the file respectively.
#       -
#
# - Directory: <- Base class for all directory objects
#    description:
#       an abstract base class for all directory objects.
#   purpose:
#       This class will provide a base class for all directory objects. This class will be used to create a common
#       interface for all directory objects that will be used by the LLM. This will allow the LLM to interact with
#       directories in a consistent manner.
#   Fields:
#       - path: str - the path to the directory
#       - files: list - a list of Files in the directory
#       - directories: list - a list of Directories in the directory
#       - parent: Directory | None - the parent directory of the directory
#       - is_root: bool - a flag to indicate if the directory is the root directory
#   Initialize Methods:
#       - __init__: -> None
#           - self
#           - path: str - the path to the directory
#           - parent: Directory | None = None - the parent directory of the directory
#           - is_root: bool = True - a flag to indicate if the directory is the root directory
#
#           - description:
#               initialize the directory object
#           - procedure:
#             This method takes the path to the directory as the base argument and recursively builds the directory
#             structure by creating new directory and file objects along the way, so that the JSON object that is
#             produced by the serialize method will contain all directories as new objects containing all files and
#             subdirectories as new objects.
#        - from_json: -> Directory
#           - cls
#           - json: dict(JSON)
#           - write: bool = False
#           - write_path: str | None = None
#
#           - description:
#              create a directory object from a JSON object, optionally creating the directory on the file system
#           - procedure:
#              This method will take a JSON object that was created by the serialize method and create a directory
#              object from it. The write flag will determine if the directory is created on the file system. If the
#              write flag is set to True, the write_path argument will be used to determine the location of the
#              directory on the file system. If the write_path argument is not provided, the directory will be created
#              in the current working directory.
#
#        - create_directory: -> Directory
#           - cls
#           - path: str
#           - parent: Directory | None = None
#           - is_root: bool = False

#           - description:
#              create a directory object
#           - procedure:
#              This method will create a new directory object. The path argument will be used to determine the location
#              of the directory on the file system. The parent argument will be used to determine the parent directory
#              of the new directory. The is_root argument will be used to determine if the new directory is the root
#              directory.
#
#   Methods:
#      - serialize: -> dict(JSON)
#         description:
#            serialize the directory object to a dictionary
#         purpose:
#            This method will be used to serialize the directory object to a dictionary that can be converted to JSON
#            and stored in a file. This will allow the LLM to save the state of the directory object and load it back
#            in later.

#      - get_file: -> File
#         - self
#         - name: str
#         - recursive: bool = False

#         - description:
#            get a file object from the directory
#         - purpose:



#
# - Codebase: -> Directory
#    description:
#       a wrapper for a root directory.
#    purpose:
#      This class will be used by several of the code-writing skills and the documentation skills to provide a root
#      directory that the code will be read from, interacted with, and written to. This will allow the user to have a
#      controls over what files on a system are accessed and modified by the LLM.
